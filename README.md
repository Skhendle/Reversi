# Reversi
Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board. There are sixty-four identical game pieces called disks, which are light on one side and dark on the other. Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color facing up.

Created a two algorithms to play the reversi game, one places the disk randomly the smart algorithm places the disks with some intelligence which maximizes the number flips.
The project was done as a side project over the winter holidays after seeing Electrical Engineering students do for their programming course at Wits univercity. 

Note:: I have note implemented the the diagonal check!!!
